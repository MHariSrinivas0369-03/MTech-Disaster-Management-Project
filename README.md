# MTech-Disaster-Management-Project
My M.Tech final year project, titled "A Hybrid Geo-spatial Disaster Prediction and Response Framework Using a Composite Risk Algorithm and CNN-LSTM for Himachal Pradesh," is a comprehensive, Python-based system designed for proactive disaster management. The project aims to improve upon traditional methods by providing a sophisticated, multi-layered approach to prediction and response.

The system is built on a Streamlit framework and features three key layers:

Data Acquisition: It gathers real-time weather and geospatial data for 37 locations in Himachal Pradesh.

Intelligence and Decision-Making: This core layer uses a two-tiered hybrid prediction system. The first tier employs a Composite Risk Algorithm for immediate, rule-based risk scoring, while the second tier validates this with a more nuanced prediction from a conceptual CNN-LSTM model analyzing time-series data. This layer also features an intelligent scheduler that automates volunteer task assignments based on the severity of the alert.

User Interface and Response: The system is managed through a "Command Center" dashboard, which offers a clutter-free map, real-time alerts, and a "Proof of Work" simulation to demonstrate the end-to-end response process.

The project's key innovation lies in its hybrid prediction model and automated response system, making it a significant advancement in developing smart, efficient, and data-driven disaster management tools.
